# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Bumped the MessageCard schema (`libs/core/schema/message_card.schema.json`) to **1.2.0** so downstream tooling can differentiate the OAuth-aware payloads.
- Added OAuth start URL + `connection_name` hydration helpers, renderer downgrade coverage, and documentation/telemetry updates.

Older changes are recorded in the repository history.
